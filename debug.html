1. Make main table.
A. List all state names and duplicate actions list in two arrays.
B. Iterate the state names. Move all state names to next row in main table that is not an output state of any of the actions.
C. Iterate the actions duplicate. Move all actions to the next row in the main table that has no input that is listed in the states list.
Repeat B and C until empty state and duplicate actions lists.
D. Konvert the main table into a map: state name/actionid =>[x, y].

3. Iterate actions list to make inputEdgeList.
A. For each input, make an entry with [actionid, state name, state koordinate, action koordinate].

5 and 7. Do the same as inputEdgeList, except for result and error.
