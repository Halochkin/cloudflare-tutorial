# HowTo: memoize?

Memoize is the act of caching the output for a particular function given the same set of inputs. It is a good first regulator to learn. Below is a basic memoization function:

```javascript
function memoize(original) {
  const cache = {};
  return function regulator(...args) {
    const key = JSON.stringify(args);
    if (cache[key])
      return cache[key];
    return cache[key] = original(...args);
  }
}
```

## Why: memoize?

1. `fetch`. Use memoize to create your own network cache. This might be better for certain types of apps, but at the same time, investigate how your server/browser already caches network requests, as you will now have many many caches which can give you great pain.

2. Heavy `async` functions that recur against the same input values again and again, such as `decrypt`.

3. Heavy `sync` functions, such as heavy mathematics, text processing, DOM node creation.

## Which: functions can we memoize?

You should mainly memoize pure functions:

1. Pure functions get pure values as input. If you memoize a function whose input values are impure, ie. they contain state information that cannot be serialized/signatured consistently, then your memoized regulated functions might think that:
	* two functions that are given different input arguments are
	* two functions that are given identical input arguments.

2. Pure functions produce pure or "clonable" values. In this chapter we discuss how we memoize functions that produce pure values, and in the next chapter we look at how we memoize impure functions that produce "clonable" outputs.

3. Pure functions have no side effects. If your original function has side-effects, and then the memoize regulator causes some invocations to this function to be skipped, then you have a problem. If the original function has side-effects, you must evaluate if you can skip those side-effects before you memoize it.

## Why: `JSON.stringify(..)`?

Note: The regulator in the `memoize` function above creates a argument signature key using `JSON.stringify(args)`. `JSON.stringify(args)` is the recommended approach because:

1. `JSON.stringify(args)` is generic in terms of argument type and count,
2. `JSON.stringify(args)` is very simple, and
3. `JSON.stringify(args)` is relatively fast.

However, be aware that JSON doesn't distinguish between `undefined` and `null` and unset properties:
`JSON.stringify({a: [, undefined], b: undefined}) === JSON.stringify({a: [null, null]})`.

## HowTo: memoizeLRU?

LRU is short for Least Recently Used (or Last Recently Used, whichever you prefer). LRU is a simple mechanism to avoid saving everything forever, and using too much memory. In fact, if you intend for your application to run for a little while, and expect a function to be called with different arguments, then you probably should make your memoize function with an LRU strategy.

```javascript
function memoizeLRU(original, size = 100) {
  const cache = {};
  return function regulator(...args) {
    const key = JSON.stringify(args);
    if (key in cache) {
      const value = cache[key];    //we delete the key (entry)
      delete cache[key];           //and then we put the key (entry) back in  
      return cache[key] = value;   //this changes the order of the key in the object.  
    }
    const keys = Object.keys(cache); //the last used keys are at the end of Object.keys()
    keys.length >= size && delete cache[keys[0]]; //thus, keys[0] is the least recently used
    const res = original(...args);
    return cache[key] = res;
  }
}

const memoAbs = memoizeLRU(Math.abs); //
const two = memoAbs(-2);
const twotwo = memoAbs(-2);
```

## WhatAbout: `Error`s?

> Should we `memoize` our original's mistakes? Or should we just move on?

When we memoize `Error`s we must create two separate cache tables in order to simply distinguish between cached outputs that should be `return`ed and cached errors that should be `throw`n:

```javascript
function memoize(original) {
  const cache = {};
  const error = {};
  return function memoized(...args) {
    const key = JSON.stringify(args);
    if (cache[key])
      return cache[key];
    if (error[key])
      throw error[key];
    try {
      const res = original(...args);
      return cache[key] = res;
    } catch (err) {
      throw error[key] = err;
    }
  }
}
```

> If you don't want to memoize `Error`s, then simply use the basic approach. In the basic example at the beginning of the article, then if the original function fails and throws an `Error`, then the basic memoization function above will not `cache` anything: the error `throw`n will cancel the post-processing in the regulator. But. Is that a bad thing? Or a good thing? Do we want to cache previous `Error`s so to avoid calling functions to reproduce them? Or do we want to forget previous `Error`s and hope that it will just work next time?
>
> The answer is: it depends. Most of all it depends on the original function and your use of that original function. Secondly, it depends on the `Error`, its type and instance and context. For some original functions and some `Error`s you might like to try several times, for other original functions, you might like to avoid making the same mistake twice, needlessly.

## WhatAbout: `async` memoize?

When you memoize an `async` original function, then the `cache` will simply be filled with `Promise`s. As long as you don't need to handle `Error`s thrown, this is fine (also when an LRU is added).

However, if you wish to memoize `Error`s too, you must also catch the `Error`s thrown "inside" the `Promise`. The strategy would be to first assume that a `Promise` succeeds, and then once it fails, move it from the `cache` registry to the `errors` registry.

Furthermore, once we have decided to update of the `cache` registry for when a `Promise` rejects, why not also update the `cache` registry when a `Promise` resolves? If we update the `cache` registry with the resolved value when they succeed, then we have the opportunity of turning the `async` original function into a true sync function whenever the `cache` output has been resolved, saving us a microtask entry. This require an adaptation where the code is being used:

The pre-memoize code looked like this:
```javascript
const result = await getDataFromServer('https://example.com');
```

When we memoize it, it looks like this:
```javascript
const memFetch = asyncMemoize(getDataFromServer);

const tmp = memFetch('https://example.com');
const result = tmp instanceof Promise ? await tmp : tmp;
```

And this is because `await` *always* forces the rest of the code to be delayed as a microtask:
```javascript
(async function () {
  Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("two (added to the next microtask)"));
  console.log("one (current microtask)");
  console.log(await "three (added to the next microtask also)");
})();
```

Below is a demo that does this. It will manage async functions, with potential `Error`s, and update the cache register with the settled value once cleared. If the `Promise` fails belatedly, then the `Promise` and key in the cache is cleared. All with LRU enabled.

```javascript
function memoize(original, size = 100) {
  const cache = {};
  const errors = {};
  return function regulator(...args) {
    const key = JSON.stringify(args);
    if (key in cache) {
      const value = cache[key];
      delete cache[key];
      return cache[key] = value;
    }
    if (key in errors) {
      const value = errors[key];
      delete errors[key];
      throw errors[key] = value;
    }
    try {
      const res = original(...args);
      const keys = Object.keys(cache);
      keys.length >= size && delete cache[keys[0]];
      cache[key] = res;
      if (res instanceof Promise) {
        res.then(res2 => cache[key] = res2);
        res.catch(error => {
          delete cache[key];
          const keys = Object.keys(errors);
          keys.length >= size && delete errors[keys[0]];
          errors[key] = res2;
        });
      }
      return res;
    } catch (err) {
      const keys = Object.keys(errors);
      keys.length >= size && delete errors[keys[0]];
      throw errors[key] = res2;
    }
  }
}
```
