The ResponseRaceStateMachine (RR) is a async state machine pattern. It races from a starting state towards an end state,
via several intermediate states.

The RR is a acyclic graph where each state represents **both** a point in time and a point in space.

The states in the figure above is represented as circles with a unique name (`/[a-zA-Z]+/`).

Actions convert one (or more states) into one of two new states: success or error.
These outcomes are signified as black(success) and red(error) arrows.
There is no difference between success and error states, a state is just a thing in time,
in principle they can be anything such as a string, Error, an Object, undefined, false, Response, Stream etc.

The same state can be used by many different actions.

Different actions can **race** to fill a new state. In such circumstances, only the first result will count,
all later results will be disregarded.

Actions will be invoked as soon as all their incoming states are resolved. If an incoming state is optional,
meaning that an action should start even though the incoming state is not fulfilled,
the action will begin even when the incoming state has yet to be made. Optional, incoming states are prefixed with `*`
in the argument list of the action.

Actions that have incoming states and outcoming states are called computers;
Actions that have zero outgoing states and only incoming states are called observers.

The RR starts with a `request` state and returns a `Promise` with the end `.response` state + a list of Promises for all the observer states.

In JS, the RR graph is represented as an array of `[arguments, action, outcome, error]`:

<script>
  const actions = [
    [['request'], helloSunshine, 'response', 'error'],               //computer
    [['request'], maybeError, 'hello', 'maybeError'],                //computer
    [['maybeError'], maybeErrorHandler, 'error', 'error'],           //computer
    [['error'], errorToResult, 'response', 'response'],              //computer
    [['response', '*hello'], log]                                    //observer, *hello is an option incoming state
  ];
</script>

The RR is implemented using the WrapSuccessError and FirstComeWinsObject patterns.

<script type="module">
  import {cloneResponseProxy, firstComeWins} from './FirstComeWinsObject.js';
  import {wrapSuccessError} from './WrapSuccessError.js';


  function responseRaceStateMachine(request, actions) {
    const state = cloneResponseProxy(new Proxy({request}, firstComeWins));
    const observers = [];
    for (let [args, reducer, prop, propError] of actions) {
      const {success, error} = wrapSuccessError(state, reducer, args);
      prop && (state[prop] = success);
      propError && (state[propError] = error);
      prop || propError || observers.push(Promise.race([success, error]));
    }
    return ['response' in state ? state.response : undefined, observers];
  }
</script>

The RR is used in workers that await `Request` and wish to turn them into a `Response`.
In JS, the request is given as a `fetch` event, and the `Response` is returned by calling `respondWith()` on the `FetchEvent`.

In JS, especially in Cloudflare workers, the run time is taken down as soon as the `Response` passed to the `respondWith()` method is resolved.
This is good, as we often would like other tasks that were initiated, but not used in the production of the `Response` to be dropped.
But, this is also bad as we might wish to take actions such as logging or caching of results for future benefit *after* the response has been delivered.
Put simply, in the JS workers run-time, we would like to `respondWith()` the `response` state, but `waitUntil()` all the observer actions has completed.

<script>
  addEventListener('fetch', e => {
    const [response, observers] = responseRaceStateMachine(e.request, actions);
    e.respondWith(response);
    e.waitUntil(Promise.allSettled(observers));
  });
</script>

In Cloudflare workers, there is also the possibility of passing the request to the origin, ie. letting the cdn handle the request instead.
This occurse when either `e.respondWith()` is not called, or when `passThroughOnException()` is called, and an exception is called.

However, as of Jan 2021, there is a bug in the Cloudflare system. Cloudflare will **disregard** `waitUntil()` when the cdn completes handling the request. This means that we need to make some work-arounds. What we do is establish the following rules:
If the `response` is the `FetchEvent.prototype.passThroughOnException` method object, then we will trigger the CDN when all observers are complete.
We will then

<script>
  addEventListener('fetch', e => {
    const [response, observers] = responseRaceStateMachine(e.request, actions);
    e.waitUntil(observers);

    e.passThroughOnException();
    e.respondWith(async function(){
      await Promise.allSettled(observers);
      const result = await response;
      if (result === FetchEvent.prototype.passThroughOnException)
        throw new Error('use passTroughOnException to trigger the CDN.');
      return result; //todo test if respondWith(error) will be enough.
    }());
    //e.respondWith(response); we don't need this, as we are going to pass to the cdn asap
    //e.waitUntil(Promise.allSettled(observers)); //this will not have any effect, any lingering async action has ~30ms anyways
  });
</script>
